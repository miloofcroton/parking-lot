# Parking Lot

Search through lists of cars.

## New Features

* using styled-components for CSS in JS
  * add `vscode-styled-components` in VS Code to get syntax highlighting
  * https://alligator.io/react/styled-components/
  * https://www.styled-components.com/docs/basics#getting-started
* using react-helmet to manage page-level stuff (in the head element) within App.jsx instead of importing at index.html
  * https://github.com/nfl/react-helmet
* using `.jsx` instead of `.js`, which is a very minor change but makes things more explicit (had to change only the test property in webpack for it to work, plus imports require the explicit `.jsx` if from a file, which kind of like)
* when possible, use the ES6 feature of implicitly importing index.js from any folder that is itself imported. In other words, `import App from 'components/App'` is equivalent to `import App from 'components/App/index.js'`
